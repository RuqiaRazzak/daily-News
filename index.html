          <span id="extraContent">CAIRO: At least 22 Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes in Gaza on Saturday, medics said, while the Israeli military claimed it targeted gunmen operating from shelters and aid storages.

            At least 10 people were killed in an air strike near the municipality building in Deir Al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip where people gathered to receive aid, medics said.
            
            Casualties were being carried by foot, on rickshaws and private cars from the site of the attack to the hospital, medics said. The strike killed the head of the Hamas-run administrative committee in central Gaza, Diab Ali al-Jaru, a Hamas source said.
            
            The Israeli military said al-Jaru, who was also the mayor of Deir Al-Balah, was the target of the strike and that he had assisted Hamas fighters. Four more people were killed in a separate strike in the area.

          <span id="extraContent1">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) confirmed on Sunday that one citizen was among the dead in yesterday’s boat capsize incidents in Greece, while 47 Pakistanis were among the rescued.

            At least five migrants drowned after their wooden boat, carrying many Pakistanis, capsized off Greece’s southern island of Gavdos, the coastguard said on Saturday, with witnesses saying many were still missing as search operations continued.
            
            Those rescued had been transferred to the island of Crete, the coastguard said, adding that the number of those missing had not yet been confirmed.
            Coastguard boats, merchant vessels, an Italian frigate and naval aircraft have been searching the area since Greek authorities were alerted about the incident on Friday night.

        <h3>Turkiye ready to offer military training to Syria if new administration requests, says defence minister</h3>

          Turkiye ready to offer military training to Syria if new administration requests, says defence minister
          <span id="extraContent2">
            The new administration in Syria should be given a chance to govern following their constructive messages, and Turkiye stands ready to provide military training if such help is requested, Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler said.
            Nato member Turkiye backed the Syrian rebels who toppled President Bashar al-Assad last weekend, ending a 13-year civil war. Turkiye reopened its embassy in Damascus on Saturday, two days after its intelligence chief visited the Syrian capital.
            “In their first statement, the new administration that toppled Assad announced that it would respect all government institutions, the United Nations and other international organisations,” Guler told reporters in Ankara in comments authorised for publication on Sunday.

“We think that we need to see what the new administration will do and to give them a chance.”

        <h1>Justice Shah told draft rules carry his suggestions</h1>
        <h3>Justice Mandokhail responds to letter, shares copy with other JCP members.</h3>

           Justice Mandokhail responds to letter, shares copy with other JCP members
           Requests senior puisne judge to propose judges’ names for high courts after rules approval
           <span id="extraContent3">
            ISLAMABAD: In a pro­mpt response to a letter of senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court Jus­tice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, chairman of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) rule-making committee Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail on Saturday assured him that most of his suggestions have already been incorporated into the draft rules on judges’ appointment.

Justice Mandokhail, in his two-page letter, copies of which have also been shared with other JCP members, reminded Justice Shah that the committee had met twice to deliberate upon the framing of draft rules. In these meetings, the committee also took into consideration the JCP Rules, 2010.

In his five-page letter to the chairman of the rule-making committee, Justice Shah had called upon the JCP to urgently finalise ‘clear and transparent rules’ for appointing jud­ges to constitutional courts, warning that any appointments without such a fram­e­work would be unconstitutional and could undermine judiciary’s independence.

The detailed letter, written on Dec 12, undersco­red the constitutional obligation under Article 175A(4) that required the JCP to establish procedures and criteria for assessing and appointing the judges, and expressed deep concern that absence of those rules would jeopardise the rule of law, dem­ocracy, and public confidence in the judiciary.

Justice Mandokhail said he received the letter on Dec 13, after the JCP had been reconstituted under the 26th amendment, of which both he and Justice Shah besides other judges were members. Since the JCP is vested with the power to make rules under the constitution, the letter added, the commission in its Dec 6 meeting unanimously authorised JCP chairman Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to constitute a committee to fulfil the constitutional obligation.

Subsequently, the CJP with Justice Shah’s consultation constituted a panel and tasked it with drafting rules related to the regulation of procedure, including the procedure and criteria for assessment, evaluation and fitness for appointment of judges under Article 175A(4), the letter said, adding that the committee in its two meetings took into consideration the JCP Rules, 2010, and deliberated upon the framing of draft rules.

“It is important to mention here that incidentally, most of the suggestions/requirements highlighted by you (Justice Shah) in the letter have already been incorporated in the draft rules, which, I had personally shared with you, prior to your letter under reply,” the letter said.
